this script causes the ar.drone to (attempt to) horizontally track a specified color

figure out what color value to track by clicking somewhere on the video feed

set the value of `red_tracking_color` to this value

it wouldn't kill me to make this a more simple process, but why risk it?

thanks to [Daniel Shiffman](http://www.learningprocessing.com/exercises/chapter-16/exercise-16-5/) for the pixel tracking
